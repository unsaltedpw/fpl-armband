# Agent rules for fpl-armband

[README.md](README.md) says what `armband` is and how to build, run and test it. Read
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing code and [docs/model.md](docs/model.md)
before changing the scoring; [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) maps the rest. Everything in `docs/`
is **reference** — what the system *is*. Design proposals and research notes do not belong there.

This file holds the rules an agent would otherwise get wrong here, and the project's **research
memory**: one line per verdict, closed line and shipped bug. The evidence behind them lives in the
**research vault**, the private Obsidian store reached through `~/.claude/bin/research-worktree`;
how to read and write it — worktree pairs, merging, retiring them — is in the vault's own
`README.md`. The `→ **name**` at the end of an entry names the note that carries it
(`notes/<name>.md` unless it says otherwise). "Closed lines" and "What has been measured" are
therefore **named lists** — titles and pointers, deliberately not verdicts restated. **If an entry
seems too short to act on, read the note it points at before rebuilding anything.** Three things in
the tree are also evidence: `stats/findings/` holds a narrative and a pre-registration per run,
`stats/cells/` holds the banked cells two R screens read as input, and `stats/snapshots/` holds
one-off sweep evidence for closed findings.

**The arrow between repo and vault runs one way.** The user-facing docs never reference the vault;
this file and the other agent-facing surfaces may. ⚠️ Do not add a machine path to a tracked file —
`/home/<user>/…`, or the vault's own location; `~/.claude/bin/research-worktree` is as locating as
it gets. The tree is not clean of them yet: several `internal/backtest/*_diag_test.go` diagnostics
and two `stats/*.R` scripts still hardcode dated output directories at an absolute machine path,
which is an open work item, not a precedent. ⚠️ A claim sourced only in the vault may not appear
in a commit message, review record or code comment: it must be re-derivable from a fresh checkout.
The `close-out-a-finding` skill has the detail.

⚠️ **The ACCURACY series is not committed.** It publishes as a GitHub Release asset on every push
to `main` (`.github/workflows/snapshot.yml` says why), and **the published series is not a citable
record**: nothing in this repository may point at it, for the same reason `stats/snapshots/` itself
could never be cited directly — see the retired-location guard. A figure a comment needs stated has
to be inlined at the citing site, not pointed at a release. `stats/snapshots/` still holds the
evidence directories from before 2026-08-22 and the odd one-off sweep since — check a directory's
own files before assuming which kind it is.

## Build and test

```bash
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./<package you touched>/...
```

Build and vet the whole module — they are fast and catch a break anywhere. **Test locally scoped to
the package or two you actually touched; the full suite is CI's job**, on every push and every pull
request (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Go's own test cache already re-runs what a change reaches,
including the cross-package source scans an import graph cannot see, so do not build a tool that
derives test scope (a closed line, below). Touching `config.json`, an `FPL_*` var, or `stats/*.R`
also needs `go test -count=1 ./internal/snapshot/...`. How the tests behave — live FPL API, skipped
when unreachable, invariants rather than exact values — is in [README.md](README.md#testing).

**Language server:** `gopls` for Go — use it for definitions, references and diagnostics before
grepping or reading whole files.

⚠️ **A suite that re-runs everything every time is the symptom of a FULL DISK, and so are browser
tests that fail LOCALLY on a screenshot write.** Go declines, silently, to cache a result it cannot
write. Several sessions running the suite at once have filled `/` before, most of it in
`$(go env GOCACHE)`; it drained within the hour, so it is contention, not a standing state. Check
`df -h /` before believing a red run, and `go clean -cache` if it is not draining. →
**work/ruled-out/scope-the-test-run-and-move-the-suite-to-ci**

⚠️ **`TestLayout`, the layout goldens, is skipped in CI by decision** (it detects `GITHUB_ACTIONS`
in `internal/webui/visual_test.go`): its goldens are machine-dependent, so CI there would be red on
a renderer difference rather than a visual change. `FPL_LAYOUT_GOLDENS=1` forces it back on. So
**a change touching `internal/webui`, or anything that feeds what it renders — `internal/viewmodel`
and `internal/present` both do — must be run locally with `go test ./internal/webui/ -count=1`
before it ships**: "test the package you touched" is not sufficient here, because the package that
changed and the package that owns the goldens are not always the same one. ⚠️ A machine with no
`chromium` on `PATH` skips the suite too, and a skip is not a pass. Delete this paragraph only
together with the CI skip. → **work/landed/machine-dependent-visual-goldens-keep-ci-red**

⚠️ **Do not trust any written description of CI's state, this file included — read the runs**
(`gh run list`, or the repository's Actions page). This project's CI state has gone stale under its
own description within a single day, and a stale "CI is clean" paragraph once survived five days.

**A Playwright suite drives a real `armband serve` in a real browser** — `cd e2e && npm test`,
opt-in and never part of `go test ./...`. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)'s `e2e/`
section for what it asserts and why it takes no pixel comparisons.

**Every change lands through a pull request against `main`, checked by CI.** Reviewers' findings go
in the PR description; there is no required `reviews/` record — the records already committed there
stay as history. ⚠️ **Do not rebuild the retired review ritual** — the `merge-gate` and
`review-gate` skills, `armband reviewkey`, `TestReviewCoversTheCurrentCode`: `armband` is a product
an end user runs, and a command that exists only to serve this project's own review process does not
belong in it. The mechanical landing sequence, and its footguns, is the `land-a-unit-of-work`
skill. → **work/landed/retire-the-review-ritual-and-move-the-full-suite-to-ci**

### Replay sweeps run through `scripts/replay`, and they run in parallel

```bash
EXP=G FPL_CELLS=/tmp/g.csv scripts/replay -run TestDiagTransferPolicy -v -timeout 2h
```

The wrapper compiles once and runs the binary as a child, so `go test` flag spellings are
translated rather than passed through — a flag the binary does not know is rejected, not honoured —
and `DIAG=1` is set for you. Runs beyond `FPL_REPLAY_SLOTS` (default 3) *queue* rather than race;
each run gets a memory cap set above the measured peak where a user systemd manager exists (it says
so when it runs uncapped), and prints its peak RSS. ⚠️ **Trust its exit status, not the output**: a
killed sweep leaves a partial cells file that reads downstream like a complete sweep with fewer
arms. Budget memory from [docs/replay.md](docs/replay.md), which carries the measurements and the
rest of the detail.

## Conventions

- **A correction here REPLACES the claim; it does not narrate the replacement.** This file carries
  what is true now. The history of a retraction, and the run that caused it, belongs with the
  evidence in the vault. ⚠️ Marking a withdrawal in place is correct where the evidence lives and
  wrong here, and the two being opposites is deliberate — do not "fix" it. ⚠️ **A deleted figure
  still owes its referent**: if a number survives the cut, whatever made it meaningful must
  survive with it.
- **Deterministic analysis never calls the LLM.** `internal/analysis` is pure computation.
- **Tool output is replayed on every later API call.** Keep tool JSON compact; full detail behind
  single-player lookups.
- **Every scoring term is a separate, reported multiplier.** Expose it on `PlayerMetrics` and
  `playerRow` so the agent can explain a number rather than assert it.
- **New config fields need a backfill in `config.Load`**, so existing config files stay valid.
  One narrow exception: a hand-maintained list whose membership can legitimately be empty — the
  campaign maps and `tournament_absences`. There an empty list is a *statement* and only a
  missing key is an omission. Fixed-arity lists such as `Review.Rules` and
  `MinutesWeightByPosition` still get backfills, because empty is meaningless for them.
- **Comments explain *why*.** Several carry the data that justified a constant — don't strip them.
- **Gloss a Go identifier the first time a section uses it**, in four to eight words. Not every
  occurrence, just the first per section.
- **The resident size budget** is enforced by `TestTheResidentIndexStaysSmall`. This file is
  loaded into every session, so growth is paid for by every task. The first question for a new
  entry is whether its derivation belongs in the vault and only the verdict here; if a needed
  entry still does not fit, RAISE THE BUDGET and name the claim — never drop a qualifier to fit,
  which is the failure the constant exists to prevent.

## How to read the measurements

Six terms account for most of this file.

| term | what it means here |
|---|---|
| **`HOLD`** | buy the opening fifteen and never transfer, but re-pick the eleven and the captain every week from this week's Score (horizon 1). Opening fifteen and transfers stay at 5; historical HOLD used horizon-5 fielding. **Use this for scoring** |
| **`POLICY`** | HOLD plus the weekly transfer. Still fields at horizon 5 unless WeeklyXI. **Only for transfer settings** |
| **cell** | one replayed season entered at one deadline. Six seasons × six entry gameweeks = **36 cells** per setting. Older figures may say **24 cells** (four seasons) or **12 cells** (three by four). Take the cell count from the figure, never from this row |
| **paired difference** | one setting minus the shipped one *within the same cell* — same football, same opening conditions, one thing changed. Always **per gameweek played** |
| **pts/gw** | points per gameweek. **Multiply by 38** for the season-scale figures quoted here |
| **detectable** | a detection threshold belongs to a *comparison*, not to the harness. Median **39 points a season on the four-season grid, season-clustered estimator** (start-fixed 32; six-season arithmetic roughly 26); the pooled span is 3.9 to 232 |

Recurring statistical terms: **CR2** (a cluster-robust standard error treating each season as one
group, so disagreeing seasons widen the bar rather than being averaged away); **Holm** (correction
for testing several arms at once); **MDE** (minimum detectable effect at 80% power); **argmax**
(see the box at the end of the standing rules — the most load-bearing idea here).

Where a constant cannot be resolved on points, this record decides on **mechanism** (does the
objective say what the game actually pays?) or on **shape** (a plateau with a cliff, or monotonic
movement across several settings) rather than on which single value scored highest. Picking the
highest of several noisy estimates manufactures effects.

## What the harness can resolve

**A detection threshold belongs to a comparison, not to the harness.** Compute it as
`t_crit(df) × SE × 38`, not `2 × SE × 38` — 2.571 at a CR2 df of 5 (six seasons), but **take the
df from the comparison**, since it is resolved per contrast and is often lower.
`stats/variance_components.R` prints the p = 0.05 effect and the 80%-power MDE per arm. Quote
the range between the clustered and start-fixed estimators rather than picking an end; clustering
is not uniformly conservative. A change whose mechanism is certain — one that lands almost
identically in every cell, like the vice-captain fallback — resolves at a threshold of **12.7**
on a metric this record calls noisy. → **harness-and-inference**

**The six-season grid is worth roughly 20-26 points a season on `HOLD`** (df 3 → 5) — read as an
ordering, not a point estimate. Widening helps on 10 of 11 transfer arms, median SE ratio 0.62.

**Three switches disable the archive backfills**, for reproducing an older figure:
`FPL_NO_XG_REPAIR=1` (xG backfill *and* xGC reconstruction), `FPL_NO_XGC_REPAIR=1` (xGC alone),
`FPL_NO_XG_AGGREGATE` (the xGC aggregate). `FPL_SWEEP_SEASONS=default` narrows the grid to four
seasons. **Name the data state, or do not quote a level.** The switches do *not* govern the
archive defect repairs (phantom matches, duplicate rows) — those are ungated. The four shipped
seasons are byte-identical inside the six, so grid width alone changes no cell. On the
four-season grid the switches reach almost nothing: `FPL_NO_XG_REPAIR` moved 24 of 96 cells, all
2022-23. → **archive-and-data**

**Several numbers for "the smallest effect this harness can see" exist**, each true of the thing
it measured; prefer the canonical 39. Traps: **42/147** is pooled over one sweep's arms, **~150**
belongs to the totals era, **~10-12** (`TestDiagNoiseFloor`) is a *floor* not a threshold. →
**harness-and-inference**

Two things easy to get backwards: **a threshold is not a verdict** — nearly every constant here
is worth 11 to 34 points a season, so "unresolved" is the *expected* reading for a real effect
of that size; and **the way to resolve something is to make the comparison sharper, not to run
more cells**.

**Absolute point totals are not comparable across eras of this codebase.** Fixed bugs moved them
by up to 115 points a season, and a bug that costs points unevenly across seasons does not merely
add noise — it **invents shapes**. Paired differences within a cell usually survive such a fix;
absolute totals across tables do not. Load-bearing instances: the doubles fix **+115 `POLICY` /
+106 `HOLD`** (every earlier total understates); the substitution and selling-price fixes the
other way (7-14 and ~31, over-statement); the unset congestion penalty that multiplied as 0
(28 on 2023-24, **113 on 2024-25**) which manufactured a monotone attacking-fixture ladder and
reversed the flat-bench-weight verdict; and defcon visibility (−95 on 2025-26, one of four
changes in that block — do not attribute alone). → **harness-and-inference**

- **Go for the engine, R for the inference, CSV as the contract.** Go prints no standard error,
  no t, no verdict word.
- **The prediction benchmark is a second instrument** answering a different question (the model
  orders players 28% better than a five-game average). It cannot replace the replay.
- **An ordering is cheaper to establish than a gap.** The predicted order must be committed to
  in advance.
- **Paired standard errors are optimistic in one direction and pessimistic in the other.**
- **Judge a sweep on paired differences, not on totals.** Every sweep cell runs a five-transfer
  bank regardless of season, so absolute totals from `runPolicySweep` are not comparable with a
  real replayed season.
- **Start points are three information regimes and the early one is the quietest.** A sweep
  writes its own provenance before its first cell.

## What each season can and cannot run

**A byte-identical season under an intervention is not a tie — it is a season where the
intervention could not run.** The season capability table lives in [docs/replay.md](docs/replay.md) —
it is replay documentation, needed when running a sweep, not every run. → **archive-and-data**

## Standing rules

- **Four classes take priority over anything else in the queue: security, performance, velocity,
  and a model or scoring fix** — in that order when they collide. This is **precedence, not
  worth**. Security is currently empty by construction against the FPL API (no
  authenticated surface there; `TestTheClientHasNoAuthenticatedSurface` guards its absence
  and is scoped to `internal/fpl` — it says nothing about `armband serve`'s own inbound
  listener, which is token-gated, writes config under `-persist`, and now also accepts a
  gate POST that records an email address to Postgres — the only personal data this
  project COLLECTS, as against the published FPL payloads it archives. Performance
  changes what is
  affordable to run, the binding constraint on this enterprise; velocity is the same argument one
  layer up; a scoring fix changes `Score`, therefore the ordering, therefore which footballers
  get bought.
- **Verify on staging against real live data before promoting to production, not just `go
  test`, for anything touching account-specific or live-API-dependent paths.** Staging is a
  second copy of the app in its own namespace, in the separate ops/deployment repo. That class of
  bug has passed every test and still broken `fplarmband.com` within minutes of a deploy.
  ⚠️ **Verify through the SURFACE the reader uses.** Running the binary and curling the
  endpoint are not proxies for the page. On 2026-08-23 the CLI was right, `/api/transfers`
  was right, and the page rendered `plans[0]` of five — found by a person clicking the
  button, on a candidate two earlier staging deploys had each "verified".
- **Convert per-gameweek figures by multiplying by 38. Never divide a pooled total by the cell
  count.** The six entry points give cells of 38/33/28/23/18/13 gameweeks (mean 25.5), so
  dividing by 36 understates by about a third.
- **A constant fitted against a proxy for its input is fitted to the proxy's noise too.**
- **Pre-register against a quantity that can actually move in the direction you would act on.**
- **Review the plan, not just the output, for anything that will produce a number.** A brief can
  ask an arm to test a hypothesis it cannot discriminate; that defect is invisible in a diff and
  far cheaper to fix before the run.
- **An estimator swap reads as a data change.** Name the estimator beside any figure.
- **A gap between two point estimates is not a result until it is divided by something.** A
  recorded estimate's SE is usually recoverable: the old harness printed `mean` and `t`, so
  `SE = |mean/t|`.
- **An exactly identified moment fit cannot test the mechanism it is named after.** One free
  parameter matched to one moment reproduces that moment *by construction*. Quote the fit's own
  SE, and name the season and feed of whatever it is compared against. → **scoring-model**
- **Do not quote the parts of a decomposition that telescopes.** Quote the product; never the
  wedges. → **scoring-model**
- **A recorded regime triple belongs to a ROW, and equal phases identify which.** ⚠️ A
  compression pass may not delete a paid-for rule to fit — raise the budget instead.
- **Monotonicity that the construction forces is not evidence.** Read the *size*, not the
  direction.
- **Check which *file* a number came from**, not merely whether the archive has the field.
  `players_raw.csv` is the end-of-season snapshot behind `statusAt`; `data/captures/<season>/GW*/`
  is what the point-in-time oracles read. **"The archive does not have X" is unverified until
  someone greps for X**, per season, across every source the pipeline touches — **a field the
  code fetches and throws away is not a field the project lacks**. The mirror: **a constant
  having been swept does not mean its cells were banked** — grep `stats/snapshots/*/cells/`.
- **Check that a setting is read on the path you are about to score, before you score it.** A
  setting that never arrives returns a **byte-identical null**, which looks exactly like a null
  meaning the knob does nothing. Naming the consumer is the check; naming a package is not.
- **A byte-identical result is not a tie.** It may be a comparison that never ran. Check the
  mediator — the thing the setting is supposed to act through — before reading anything into it.
- **A null is a tie, not the refutation of one.** A non-resolving comparison shows two settings
  **cannot be separated by this instrument**. What it *can* refute is a recorded **magnitude**.
- **A one-at-a-time null is a *simple-effect* null** — true of the shipped configuration and
  silent about any other. Report the factorial main effect beside the simple one, and label
  which you are quoting. Invariance results are unaffected: byte-identical stays byte-identical
  at the configuration tested, and becomes *untested* elsewhere rather than false.
- **Two levers that a mechanism says touch the same decisions get a 2×2, not two sweeps.** The
  interaction is not the expensive contrast — a difference of differences *within one cell*
  cancels the path divergence a single difference carries (season-clustered SE 0.216 against
  0.599 for the noisier main effect, no df penalty). The real cost is multiplicity: 2^k−1
  contrasts against k. Cross **pairs a mechanism names**, never a lattice — an unpredicted
  interaction found by search is an argmax over 2^k−1 contrasts.
- **Holding a confounder constant is only safe when it is constant *with respect to* the thing
  being varied.** Pinning the wildcard to a common week put the bench boost immediately after the
  rebuild in 30 of 30 cells for one arm and 3-5 of 30 for the others.
- **A diagnostic must never carry its own copy of the thing it is checking.** Where a frozen
  baseline genuinely is wanted, pin it to the package with a test.
- **Size a canary with the omitted-variable coefficient, not with a raw variance share — and on
  the link the model actually fits.** Getting it wrong is how an arm passes a check it should
  have failed; the convenient formula is the one reached for, and the error runs in the direction
  that **flatters the instrument**. Check the degrees of freedom the same way, and note that **a
  rank-deficient cluster-robust matrix can still be computable**. The worked miss is in the
  vault. → **harness-and-inference**
- **A canary is judged against the standard error of the ARM IT GATES**, which is unknown until
  the arm runs — so gating is a **necessary** condition, not a sufficient one. Where the gated
  arm does run, re-state the ceiling against the arm's own threshold. Measured: the bench-boost
  canary's 2.06 (SE 0.803) was a 22% loosening of the arm's own 2.65 (SE 1.032), in the
  flattering direction; it did not bite at a sixfold margin but decides a marginal one. →
  **chips**
- **One quantity, two implementations — this project's signature failure.**
  `TestTheSharedCellQuantitiesHaveOneImplementation` and
  `TestTheCopiedExpressionsHaveOneImplementation` scan for it. Extend an existing scan rather
  than adding a runtime equivalence test per copy: the second stops one divergence, the first
  stops the next copy. **A scan passing is not "there are no copies"** — the scans match an
  *idiom*, so they are tripwires rather than proofs. ⚠️ **Both scans are Go-only, so a copy in
  the served client is invisible to them**, which is how the transfer gate came to be decided
  twice with two different roundings. Where deleting the second copy is not available, pin the
  two languages against one table — `TestTheGateIsDecidedTheSameWayInBothLanguages` — and put
  the SEPARATING cases in it, or the pin fixes the shipped constant rather than the rule.
- **A nonlinear transform of an archive-row field is not a statement about the model.** Take the
  regressor off `Metrics`, as `TestDiagCleanSheetRegressor` does;
  `TestNonlinearTransformsScoreTheModelsOwnRegressor` scans for it. ⚠️ It catches a mismatched
  **regressor** only, never a mismatched **population**, and is blind wherever the archive and
  `PlayerMetrics` (the struct the scoring path scores a footballer from) spell a field the same
  way. → **scoring-model**
- **"No truth value" and "a truth value we cannot resolve" are different, and only the second
  describes any constant here.** An unresolvable question is still owed an answer if the
  instrument improves; a meaningless one is not.
- **A better predictor can make a worse policy.** The transfer search is an **argmax**, so it
  lives in the tail of the estimate distribution. Removing a **bias** is safe; trading bias for
  **variance** is not.
- **A bias shared by every player in a position is not an ordering error; a within-position bias
  is.** "Shared" must mean shared on `Score`, not on one component: a position-wide multiplier
  on one additive term reorders within the position whenever players differ in that term's
  share. The rule also needs a **quota** to bite, covers **ordering** only, and `Optimize` is a
  knapsack against one budget, so a position-wide level can still change who is bought. Prefer
  the sibling rule, which is unqualified: **a measured bias does not imply a correction exists.**
- **Correcting a measured bias has lost points five times.**
- **An oracle that accepts on the sign of the quantity it is scored on raises that quantity by
  construction.** Check the **contrasts** as well as the levels.
- **A confinement check on a path that cannot carry the effect confirms nothing. Pair it with a
  liveness check that must move.** Confinement is usually a *code* fact, so re-running it can
  only fail; the check with power is the mirror that moves where it must.
- **The wild cluster bootstrap may withdraw support from a CR2 rejection; it may never grant
  one.** Webb 6-point weights on the season, enumerated exactly (6^6 = 46,656 draws, no seed, no
  Monte-Carlo error); it swaps a normality assumption for a **symmetry** one, and on this
  balanced intercept-only design CR2 *is* the equal-weighted t-test on season means, verified
  bit-for-bit. It is a function of season totals alone, so it cannot see cell-level
  concentration — that is `concentration_screen.R`'s job. **Quote `S_eff` and the floor
  `6/6^S_eff` beside every p**: 0.1667 at 2, 0.0278 at 3, 0.00463 at 4, 0.000129 at 6. An arm
  whose floor exceeds 0.05 is *unmeasurable*, not null. → **harness-and-inference**
- **A snapshot's figures are not guaranteed to have come from its own commit.** `FPL_MODEL_CSV`
  appends outside the repository and the renderer keeps the newest row per figure by wall-clock.
  `snapshot.ModelRunIDs` warns when the CSV holds more than one run.
- **A lock that looks necessary is evidence of a bug elsewhere.** Correct the numbers and let
  everything downstream recompute. And **check the claim before you exclude on it.**

## Things that have already bitten

Shipped bugs, each now covered by a regression test. Re-introducing one is easy. Full narratives
in the vault; the lesson and the pinning test here — the test is the guard. →
**harness-and-inference**, **optimiser-and-squad**, **archive-and-data**

- **A minutes floor written as a season total must be scaled before it is compared, at EVERY
  call site.** → **transfer-policy**. `buildTransferBoard` filtered on a bare
  `c.Minutes < 600`; against fresh-season aggregates 0 of 609 players cleared it, so the pool
  was empty and every transfer surface answered "nothing would improve this squad" for about
  seven gameweeks. `ScaledMinMinutesFor` already existed for exactly this and had been applied
  to `Optimize` alone. Pinned by `TestTheTransferPoolScalesItsMinutesFloor` (source scan).
  ⚠️ **There were THREE copies.** The first fix took one; `internal/agent/tools.go`'s own pool
  was still unscaled afterwards, while the same file scaled the floor correctly twenty lines
  above. The guard now reads every file that builds a pool, because one scoped to the file
  whose bug prompted it reads as coverage and is not.

- **The hit ceiling is a knob, not a clamp, and both expressions of it must move together.** →
  **transfer-policy**. Pinned by `TestTheHitCeilingIsReadByTheFundedPairBranch` (source scan)
  and `TestTheHitCeilingIsReachableAndDefaultsToOne`.
- **A differential corpus on a dyadic score grid cannot see a re-associated sum, and the
  optimiser's was entirely dyadic.** Sums of eleven exact multiples of 0.25 are exactly
  representable, so any regrouping of one is bit-identical *by construction* — a comparison green
  because it never ran. It shipped a "bit-identical" claim for `bestFormation`'s prefix fold that
  was false. `optimizerdiff_test.go` now carries a continuous arm, and records why a DECIMAL grid
  must not be added: tenths are both non-dyadic and coarse enough for two formations to tie
  exactly, which is the one region where the fold really does pick differently. →
  **optimiser-and-squad**
- **A long-lived process holds one engine for every request, and mutations survive the request.**
  `ApplyChipPlan` shortens `Weights.Horizon` for a planned wildcard — correct for that build,
  permanent unless it is put back. Save and restore whatever a request mutates. The `serve` endpoint
  was the shipped instance; pinned by `TestAPlannedWildcardDoesNotShortenTheNextReadersHorizon`.
  A twin instance lived in `internal/agent/tools.go`, where the toolbox engine is shared by all
  tools in a turn and the runner fans them through an errgroup; it was closed by removing the
  mutating call entirely, pinned by `TestNoAgentToolAppliesTheChipPlanToTheSharedEngine`.
- **`runPolicySweep` builds cells at `WeeklyXI: false`, and several diagnostics run at `true`.**
  Pin the setting in `apply` and stamp it.
- **Never compare a replayed float for exact equality against a BANKED total: a banked total is
  reproducible from a commit AND a machine, and only the commit is recorded.** Two fresh arms run
  back to back on one machine hold the machine fixed, and there exact equality is the correct and
  **sharpest** test of a rewrite claiming to preserve answers — it has no detection threshold,
  because the prediction is exactness, so one differing cell refutes it at power 1. Do not quote
  the first clause to block the second. → **harness-and-inference**
- **The doubles guard must key on `(element, fixture)`, never `(element, gameweek)`.**
  `season.go` accumulates, never assigns; the phantom/duplicate counts are pinned at load.
- **Anything reading fixture results must be gated by gameweek.** →
  **archive-and-data**. Pinned by `TestPointInTimeHidesFutureResults`. `PreSeasonWith` itself
  is still unfiltered — `teamBands` stays safe on its own `Finished` check, and
  `buildTeamRates` is now gated on `FinishedProvisional`, so the pre-season leak that fed
  `magnitudeAttack`/`magnitudeDefence` behind `FPL_MAGNITUDE` is fixed. Pinned by
  `TestTeamRatesIgnoreAMatchStillBeingPlayed` (`internal/analysis`) and
  `TestPreSeasonTeamRatesCannotSeeTheSeasonsResults` (`internal/backtest`).
- **FPL's aggregates reset at GW1, so the denominator must follow.** Use `Engine.DataWindow()`,
  never the constant 38. `TestDataWindowTracksTheSeason`. ⚠️ **`DataWindow` alone is not enough
  during the live GW1 gap** — `SeasonHasStarted()` true, `GameweeksPlayed()` still 0, a span of
  days — where it answers a pre-season 38 that is false for every club: FPL zeroes the whole
  league at the first kickoff, and within the gap some clubs have a completed match and some have
  not begun. `GameweeksPlayed()>0` and `SeasonHasStarted()` are two implementations of one
  question and agree all season except this gap — six call sites across five PRs came from
  using the former where the latter was meant: #39, #42, the squad pool's minutes floor,
  `bonusEvidence` and `AssemblyBudget` (both #45), `squadPriceGameweek`. (#40 shipped the same
  day in the same window but is mechanistically distinct — a blend-weight dilution, not a
  swapped predicate — and is not a seventh instance of this specific pattern.) Use the shared
  `inLiveGameweekGap()` predicate, whose doc comment routes
  every call site to one of three classes: `matchesAvailable` for a rate DENOMINATOR (per-club
  `TeamMatchesStarted`, only when `>0`), `minutesFloorWindow`/the minutes-evidence mix for a
  sample-size THRESHOLD or evidence COUNT (per-club `TeamMatchesFinished`, always including 0 —
  never `TeamMatchesStarted` there, a live match's minutes are still climbing), and
  `bonusEvidence`/`AssemblyBudget` for aggregate PROVENANCE (`SeasonHasStarted()` alone, no
  per-club signal — the quantity itself, e.g. `el.Minutes`, already carries per-player evidence).
  ⚠️ **Two of these bugs cancelled each other out, and fixing one exposed the other as a live
  production incident.** `AssemblyBudget`'s gate and `run()`'s squad-price-fetch gate both used
  `GameweeksPlayed()==0` for the same "has this manager bought anything" question; fixing the
  first alone (correctly) turned the second's dormant nil `Bank`/`SquadValue` into a hard 500 for
  the real production entry, deployed and rolled back within minutes. **A fix in this family is
  only proven by exercising the live gap end to end, not by `go test` on the changed function
  alone** — grep every other reader of the two raw predicates before shipping one fix among them.

- **Every per-90 rate must go through `blendFor`, counting stats included.**
  `TestCountingStatsGoThroughTheBlend`.
- **A player with no prior is not a player with no uncertainty.** `shrinkToLeague` pulls rates
  **and** minutes/start-share toward the position's league rates — volume was added 2026-08-23
  and made unconditional 2026-08-25. ⚠️ It was briefly gated on `GameweeksPlayed() == 0`; that
  gate was a workaround for the optimiser bug below, not a statement about evidence, and must
  not be reintroduced. `TestAFinishedGameweekDoesNotMakeADebutantLookNailed`.
- **A player with NO prior read ZERO minutes, not the league average.** →
  **recency-and-priors**. `blendRatesCode`'s pre-season branch returned early when `Priors`
  held no entry, so 122-284 players a season — summer signings, promoted-club regulars, the
  population the hand-written overrides exist for — scored as if they would never play. They
  now take the position's league rates. ⚠️ **Read that fallback's ordering WITHIN position,
  never pooled**: it is constant inside a position and differs between them, so a pooled rank
  over unknowns is mostly a rank by position and carries either sign for that reason. ⚠️ Its
  LEVEL over-states against known players; MID and FWD resolve under Holm, DEF and GK do not.

- **A player who never plays generates no evidence that he does not play, and a SHARE knob
  cannot fix it.** → **recency-and-priors**. `shrinkToLeague` weights a player's own rate by
  `wMin = n90/(n90+BlendMinutesK)`, so one with no minutes keeps `wMin` 0 and takes the league
  average whole, all season. At GW20 a no-prior player unplayed for twenty gameweeks is
  predicted **41.9 min/match and averages 0.6**; a no-prior player who HAS played reads
  1.1-1.4x and a player with history is calibrated. ⚠️ **So the blended in-season figure
  (2.4-3.2x) averages two populations wanting opposite treatment**, and scaling the fallback
  would break the near-right group to patch the far-wrong one. `UnknownPriorShare` is the wrong
  lever here and does not reach the in-season path at all. Whether `blankRunFactor` misses this
  population or is too weak is **untested**.
- **`starts_per_90` is not a rotation signal.** Use minutes and starts against the full
  38-game season.

  `TestOptimizerIsNeverWorseThanAnExactSeed`, `TestNoPremiumSquadBeatsTheOptimum`.
- **An admissibility bound that ignores a hard constraint makes FEASIBILITY depend on score
  ORDER.** → **optimiser-and-squad**. `minCostToFill` took `clubCount` and never read it — the
  identifier appeared once, in the signature, and Go does not warn on an unused parameter. So
  the greedy fill's bound summed the cheapest candidates per position regardless of the
  three-per-club cap while `canAdd` enforced it, and the walk committed to picks it could not
  complete. `Optimize` reported "could not fill a legal 15-man squad within £82.0m" for a pool
  holding a legal fifteen at £65.3m. Replaced by `fillBound`: a club-relaxed per-position
  optimum, then an exact DP over clubs only where that passes. ⚠️ Adding a club counter to the
  old sort OVER-estimates — reasoned, not pinned; the worked case is on `fillBound`'s own doc
  comment — and an over-estimating bound silently rejects reachable squads, which is a
  search-quality change rather than a bug fix. That consequence IS pinned:
  `TestSquadFillBoundDifferentialHasTeeth` inflates the shipped bound by a tenth of a million

  reconstruction **14.0%, −0.1%, r 0.937** — a dead heat, and the reconstruction is the *less*
  biased. They agree to **5.5%** when both eat the same xG provider. ⚠️ **The 17.4% gap in the

## Closed lines — do not rebuild these

Each was measured and lost, closed on mechanism, or withdrawn after re-measurement. **A named
list — titles and pointers, deliberately**: a title plus a pointer routes a reader to the verdict
in the note the bold name points at. Do not "finish the job" by deleting the list, and do not
re-derive a verdict from a title alone.

- **Do not build a custom fixture-difficulty rating, do not target the worst defences, do not
  band attack and defence separately, and do not move the fixture window.** → **fixtures-and-difficulty**
- **Do not extend recency to rates.** → **recency-and-priors**
- **The clean-sheet over-prediction ships uncorrected.** → **scoring-model**
- **Neither the clean-sheet factor `f` nor the defensive fixture ladder separates from 1 on the
  stratum that carries the verdict, and the ladder is the higher of the two point estimates rather
  than the established location of the excess.** ⚠️ **No pooled figure may be quoted, except in
  this sentence, which disowns it.** ⚠️ The leak's SIZE is unmeasurable and this does NOT retract
  the ladder's 1.5688. → **scoring-model**

- **Do not ship a state trigger for the wildcard, and do not read a wildcard replay as a
  valuation.** ⚠️ **Both halves have now been re-opened and BOTH survived**, so this line rests
  entirely on measurement. The valuation half, 2026-08-25: a wildcard-against-no-wildcard arm
  reproduces the null it predicts. **The trigger half, 2026-08-26 — it previously said
  "unre-examined" and that was already false when written.** Three readings were built and swept
  against a control that plays no trigger at all, 36 cells, one commit, `dirty=false`:
  **the shipped cost rule reads −3.53** a season-path (CR2 SE 3.66, threshold 9.4) — it is
  NEGATIVE and it takes MORE hits than the control, 2.06 against 1.94; single-week XI drift
  +3.50 (threshold 11.2); the fixture-aware lookahead +1.67 (threshold 11.1). **Nothing
  resolves and the best arm is a third of its own threshold.** ⚠️ Higher lookahead bars fire in
  4 of 36 cells and are inert rather than good — read the fire count before any null here.

- **⚠️ Do not expect a fixture-aware reading of squad drift to pick different weeks — measured,
  and it does not.** `WildcardDriftBar` reads the horizon-5 engine where `FixtureLoadInScore()`
  is FALSE, so it is a five-week average blind to the doubles inside its own window;
  `WildcardLookaheadBar` re-reads one gameweek at a time at horizon 1, where fixture load IS
  scored. At matched fire rate — 14 and 15 of 36 — the two pick **adjacent median
  gameweeks (14 and 15)**, take the **same hits (1.69/cell)**, and differ by +1.67 against +3.50
  with thresholds above 11. The readings correlate **0.884**. ⚠️ This says the two RANK weeks
  alike; it is not evidence that fixture awareness is worthless elsewhere. ⚠️ **It read "the same
  median gameweek" until the fire counts got a committed generator** — the ad-hoc script behind
  them took the upper element of an even-length list, so three of seven medians read one rung
  high. Regenerate with that directory's `fires.R`, never by hand. → **chips**

## What has been measured

**A named list — titles and pointers.** The evidence and the numbers live in the notes the bold
names point at; a verdict here cannot be checked from this checkout (never write "I verified" when
you mean "I re-ran"). Re-measuring is still how a verdict falls, and the new number then sits
*beside* the recorded one, so say which you have. Absence from this list is weak evidence of
absence — nothing checks it stays complete.

### What a player is worth: the scoring terms

- **P(appears) ships as one implementation.** → **scoring-model**
- **A club's expected goals sum to the club on average but not club by club.** The short-clock
  `FPL_TEAM_FORM` is open and unresolved, built and ships off. → **scoring-model**
- **The 2026/27 bonus rules are measurable on old football.** → **scoring-model**
- **The pre-2024-25 bonus-points schedule is decoded, not read off an announcement.** ⚠️ Do not
  check "the archive's only goalkeeper goal" with a `position == 'GK'` filter — join
  `players_raw.csv`'s `element_type` instead. → **scoring-model**
- **The defcon term is about half redundant for defenders — quote 50%.** → **scoring-model**
- **Four findings that change nothing shipped.** → **scoring-model**
- **Fixture multipliers are applied per fixture, not averaged.** → **scoring-model**
- **The captain had no vice-captain and the replay forfeited the bonus.** →
  **harness-and-inference**
- **The minutes model under-reacts to the onset of an absence.** → **scoring-model**
- **The bonus term should not be a constant.** → **scoring-model**
- **Real team news is measured and too small, rather than unmeasurable.** →
  **harness-and-inference**
- **Perfect minutes is the largest information bound on the *scoring* side — two capabilities,
  none of it resolves.** ⚠️ Quote ≈93 with its data state — it moved with the starts harvest. →
  **harness-and-inference**

### Recency and priors

- **Minutes need recency; rates do not.** → **recency-and-priors**
- **`MinutesHalfLife` ships at 4, and the reason is asymmetry, not the points.** →
  **recency-and-priors**
- **Multi-season priors come from FPL's `history_past`, which returns them oldest first.** →
  **recency-and-priors**
- **A thin prior season is a fallback trigger, not a smoothing opportunity.** →
  **recency-and-priors**
- **`prior_half_life` stays off — unresolved, not favourable.** → **recency-and-priors**

### Fixtures

- **Fixture *count* is a different term from fixture *difficulty*, and it is the one thing in
  the fixture family that pays.** HOLD's weekly pick ships at horizon 1 so count is in Score;
  this-week difficulty on the same fifteen did not clear. Ladders/`fixture_weight`/`BandStrength`
  stay. Historical HOLD used horizon-5 fielding. → **fixtures-and-difficulty**
- **Fixtures matter hugely per match and barely per horizon.** → **fixtures-and-difficulty**
- **The model is already position-dependent by construction.** → **fixtures-and-difficulty**
- **Neither fixture ladder has a shape** — 3 cells, absolute totals, pre-defcon-visibility,
  *unmeasured on the current grid* rather than a measured null. → **fixtures-and-difficulty**
- **The model is not timing fixtures in practice, and there is little to time.** →
  **fixtures-and-difficulty**
- **`fixture_weight` is clamped to [0,1]** — setting 1.4 is silently identical to 1.0.

### The archive

- **The replay was buying players who had already left, and players who had not arrived yet.** →
  **archive-and-data**
- **Extending the archive backwards buys two seasons, and a third on `HOLD` only.** →
  **archive-and-data**
- **Expected goals conceded is reconstructed for the four seasons that carry none.** →
  **archive-and-data**
- **`FPL_NO_XG_REPAIR=1` also disables the xGC reconstruction.** → **archive-and-data**
- **FPL revises team strength mid-season, in waves, and the revisions are outcome-driven.** ⚠️
  Mechanism, not measurement — this does NOT retract b2 = 1.5688, and "0 of 380 difficulties
  changed" licenses nothing. → **archive-and-data**
- **The payloads carry a great deal the code ignores.** → **archive-and-data**
- **The xG harvest left no coverage hole on goals, and left the assist channel about twice as
  exposed as a natively-fed season.** ⚠️ "Goals: closed" rests on the ungated population and is
  narrower than it reads; a naive `xg+xa > 0` gate would be wrong. → **archive-and-data**
- **The exposed-return leak into the conversion fit is sized, and dropping those rows is
  refused.** → **scoring-model**
- **The weekly capture yields nothing this season.** → **archive-and-data**

### The harness

- **The armband overlay sees hindsight (+142.53 a season-path vs threshold 23.26) and does not
  resolve entry-pinned vs weekly (−10.14 vs 20.52).** Season means of the pin range +24 to −31;
  start=6 carries the pooled negative. Does not retract 255-vs-228. → **harness-and-inference**

- **The replay's noise is sensitivity, not randomness.** → **harness-and-inference**
- **The noise splits differently on the two metrics.** → **harness-and-inference**
- **Captaincy is 45% of `HOLD`'s residual variance, and removing it is still worse.** →
  **harness-and-inference**
- **A perfect armband is worth 210 points a season, and it is the largest resolvable thing
  here.** → **harness-and-inference**
- **The archive carries what a field average needs.** → **harness-and-inference**

### The weekly transfer decision

- **The transfer charge is a volume brake, not an anti-churn device.** → **transfer-policy**
- **Team value compounds, and the half-of-any-rise selling rule taxes 62% of it.** →
  **transfer-policy**
- **Perfect price timing is too small for this harness to see.** → **transfer-policy**
- **The premium-acquisition over-valuation was never measured.** → **transfer-policy**
- **The policy never banks a transfer at shipped config, and the zero is checked, not
  degenerate.** → **transfer-policy**
- **Reach is not the problem: 97.6% of worth-taking two-move packages are already reachable.** →
  **transfer-policy**
- **The sell side is calibrated; its error is entirely availability.** → **transfer-policy**
- **The transfer path's noise, measured cleanly, is 303 points of spread.** → **transfer-policy**
- **`MinGainHit` 3.0 stands, the hits mostly pay, and nothing ships.** →
  **transfer-policy**
- **The flat `free_transfer_value` ladder resolves nothing — 2.0 ships unchanged,
  measured-and-unresolved rather than untested.** → **transfer-policy**
- **Weekly transfers toward the forming popular core do not clear POLICY** —
  `template_core_transfer_k` stays 0. →
  **memory/2026-09-08-weekly-transfers-toward-the-forming-core-do-not-clear-policy**

### Constants

- **The flat prior ships at k=8.** → **constants-and-sweeps**
- **`LeagueShrinkK` is split out from `BlendRateK` and ships at 8** — the replay reading is
  **unresolved, not a measured loss** (POLICY −0.843, t −1.94; HOLD a flat null). →
  **constants-and-sweeps**
- **`BandStrength` has banked cells and still does not resolve — and the arm that DECIDED it is
  still unrun.** → **constants-and-sweeps**
- **The fixture mediator's canary is `band_strength` 2, and `band_ready_weeks` is not a canary
  at all.** → **constants-and-sweeps**
- **`BlendRateK` is banked and nothing resolves.** → **constants-and-sweeps**
- **Calibrate against data, not intuition — and check what a multiplier multiplies before
  calibrating it.** → **constants-and-sweeps**
- **No scoring constant with banked `HOLD` cells is measurably a schedule.** →
  **constants-and-sweeps**
- **`MinutesWeight` ships at 1.0 from 2026-08-25: a judgement to ship neutral, not a
  measurement — this harness cannot locate an optimum on it.** ⚠️ At 1.0
  `MinutesWeightByPosition` is inert. → **constants-and-sweeps**
- **Giving an unknown player a prior buys nothing measurable, and the price tilt is
  closed on mechanism.** `HOLD` +0.8 a season against a threshold of 25.3; both tilt
  arms negative or flat. ⚠️ **Read it as ~6-8 live cells, not 36** — `UnknownPriorShare`
  is pre-season-only and `PriceMinutesPrior` fades by GW11, so 24 of 36 cells are
  byte-identical by construction. `PriceMinutesPrior` stays at 0.
  `stats/cells/2026-08-28-unknownprior/`. → **recency-and-priors**

### Chips

- **All four chips are modelled, and the replay cannot value a wildcard.** → **chips**
- **SPENDING BOTH CHIP SETS AS A MANAGER DOES IS THE LARGEST CHIP EFFECT HERE**: first set spent
  before it expires, wildcard/free hit/bench boost bundled on the second-half calendar, triple
  captain last. **+38.1 a season-path (t 4.51, thr 21.7) on legacy and +38.4 (t 4.43) on measured
  xGC, 6/6 seasons each**, resolving on both. ⚠️ **NOT the only result that agrees across sources
  — bench boost does too (+4.4/+4.5) and resolves on both at a HIGHER t.** Largest, not most
  robust. ⚠️ **How much of it is the first set does NOT resolve**: +11.9 legacy (t 1.91, thr 16.1)
  / +15.6 measured (t 2.22, thr 18.0), positive in 15 of 36 cells — a point estimate, and the
  arithmetic that an expired set is lost is a separate argument. Replays every season under
  today's two-set rules on purpose. `2026-08-25-tworegime/`. → **chips**
- **⚠️ EVERY OTHER CHIP FIGURE DEPENDS ON THE COMMIT AND THE xGC SOURCE — quote none without its
  arm.** Calendar anchoring: +27.0 at 4gw sight (t 5.33) on the legacy reconstruction, RESOLVING;
  the pre-#82 +20.6/t 3.63 is superseded. +26.4 on measured with the SE doubled 5.06→11.41,
  t 2.32, NOT resolving — only the full-sight hindsight arm survives there. ⚠️ **Which arm to
  believe CANNOT be decided by ranking standard errors, and the three-season design that would
  have tried is refuted by its own band.** Run 2026-08-26 in the three seasons where all three
  inputs describe the same football, one commit, one declared variable, 18 cells an arm. **df 2
  puts the 95% band on a ratio of two SD estimates at F(2,2) = [0.16, 6.24]**, so a 2× ratio is
  invisible there and the recorded doubling is **not testable** on that grid — NOT "not
  reproduced". ✅ **What IS estimable is the WITHIN-season spread** (df 15, band [0.59, 1.69]):
  36.16 / 36.07 / 31.09, max ratio **1.16** — **a 2× within-season difference between the inputs
  is EXCLUDED**. ✅ **The per-cell effect is predominantly not a property of the cell**: paired
  differences correlate −0.36 / 0.06 / 0.03 across inputs where the null predicts **+1** (
  differencing removes the shared season path), so **an SE computed on one input does not transfer
  to another**. SE(r) ~0.26 at n 18 — excludes large shared structure, cannot separate 0 from 0.3.
  ⚠️ **The arm means are INDISTINGUISHABLE, not "robust"**: difference-of-differences +5.33/+2.83/
  −2.50 against floors of **36.8 / 61.3 / 34.6**, so the input could be worth up to ~60 a
  season-path and this would not see it. What survives positively is sign-consistency — three arms
  with barely-correlated residuals, all positive at every sight setting. ⚠️ **Do not read per-arm
  t off that grid** (6.33/6.99 at 4gw would "resolve"): either the df-2 SEs rank or they do not,
  and this entry takes the second position. ⚠️ **The reconstruction manufacturing precision stays
  UNPROVEN** — its tighter within-season spread gives paired Levene p 0.43/0.54 and Pitman-Morgan
  (more powerful, correct for correlated variances) p 0.47/0.48. `2026-08-26-xgc-three-inputs/`,

  Free hit: +14.5/t 2.44 pre-`5b970338`, +21.0/t 3.60 after it, +20.7 with SE
  11.81 on measured. **Bench boost is the only component resolving on every arm and commit**
  (+4.4-5.6, LOSO 6/6). ⚠️ `per_path` always — `per_gw` is wrong for an event count and has
  produced two retracted figures. `2026-08-25-anchored-xgcarms/`, `2026-08-25-xgcarms/`. → **chips**
- **The two triple-captain instruments disagree and the replay is no longer the blind one.** Per
  decision the rule delivers +7.95 realised a chip (t 2.92, threshold 7.0); the season-path
  replay of the same rule reads +2.25 against a threshold of 4.19, so it could have resolved that
  and did not. Ownership is the leading and untested explanation. ⚠️ The old "the replay's
  threshold exceeds the effect" defence was a `per_gw` artefact and is withdrawn. → **chips**
- **The wildcard's own value stays unmeasurable here — a wildcard against no wildcard is a tie
  (−7.6, threshold 18.2) because this policy has nothing for it to undo.** → **chips**
- **A bench-boost PLACEMENT contrast is measurable at a threshold of 2.65 — the comparison, not
  the effect.** → **chips**
- **`OptionPricing.CongestionSensitivity = 0` means the DEFAULT of 1.0, not off.** → **chips**
- **The scoring-chip timing `+0.000` is a declared invariance, not a result.** → **chips**
- **Only two of the four chips are *preparation* problems.** → **chips**
- **The two preparation channels overlap by about a third on the chip week and fight over a
  season.** → **chips**
- **Truncating the transfer horizon at a planned wildcard is bounded, and closed on mechanism.** →
  **chips**
- **Triple-captain preparation changed no decision, which is not a measured zero.** → **chips**
- **Do not project the two-set chip rule backwards to buy chip observations.** → **chips**

### The optimiser, the squad, and the money

- **Locking the popular core into the opening fifteen does not clear HOLD** —
  `template_core_k` stays 0. →
  **memory/2026-09-08-locking-the-popular-core-does-not-clear-hold**
- **The optimiser was garbage-collection-bound, not compute-bound.** → **optimiser-and-squad**
- **The optimiser's move set** needs N downgrades funding one upgrade; the ranking proxy may
  filter but must never decide. → **optimiser-and-squad**
- **Money is worth what it can still be turned into.** → **optimiser-and-squad**
- **The bench is a hedge and its slots are not interchangeable.** → **optimiser-and-squad**
- **Two elevens exist on purpose.** → **optimiser-and-squad**
- **Ordering inside the held squad is worth 2.4-3.2 points a gameweek over persistence**, and the
  whole arena above it — perfect hindsight ordering within the same fifteen — is 8.6-9.9, of
  which captaincy is 5.6-5.8 and XI selection 3.0-4.2. Levels hold under both xGC sources.
  ⚠️ This does **not** price the disputed top-40 tail weakness; it measures the arena that
  weakness lives in. ⚠️ The hindsight arms are clairvoyance, not headroom — the captaincy figure
  is mostly single-week variance nobody could hold, and is not the value of a better captain
  model. ⚠️ The edge is a MEAN and not a description of a season: positive in 6 of 6 seasons when
  the squad is re-optimised weekly, but 5 of 6 when it is held, with 2023-24 reading −0.32.
  ⚠️ The block-length comparison is environment-conditional and its one significant cell changes
  verdict with `FPL_XGC_EXTERNAL_DIR`; quote the source or do not quote it. → **optimiser-and-squad**

## Season maintenance

Four hand-maintained lists are not in the FPL API and must be re-derived every summer — the
README's "What you must configure by hand" names them, and the `fpl-season-maintenance` agent does
the work. They ship as dated 2026/27 defaults (`DefaultEuropeanCampaigns`, `DefaultDomesticCups`,
`DefaultNewCoachClubs`, `DefaultRestPlayers`). What is easy to get wrong:

- **Competition windows** per club, with start *and* end dates. `armband congestion` reports
  what is set and how stale it is.
- **Managerial changes.** The test is not "is the manager new" but "was last season's data
  produced under him" — which is why Tottenham is on the list and Manchester United is not.
- **Post-tournament rest.** Names must match the FPL spelling exactly, accents included.
- **Nationality code lists** for travel load — `armband nations` maps the opaque codes.

Two regression tests fail loudly if a hand-maintained name stops resolving, because that failure
is otherwise silent.

**Three of the four lists are display-only, and one is live on the scoring path.**

- All eight congestion penalties ship at 1.00, so the competition windows and the nationality
  lists can only mis-inform a human, not mis-score a player.
  `TestTheShippedCongestionBlockIsInert` makes re-enabling deliberate; the channel would be
  minutes, not `Score`. `DefaultNewCoachClubs` is display-only too, through `NewCoachPenalty`
  in `rolerisk.go` — a ninth penalty, outside the congestion block.
- **`DefaultRestPlayers` is live.** `blendFor` applies `restFactor`, multiplying
  `MinutesPerMatch` and `StartShare`. Live at **GW1 and GW2 only** (`restFactor` returns 1 once
  the next gameweek is past `rest_gameweeks`, which is 2) — so it bites in exactly the two
  gameweeks after the summer maintenance that was supposed to have checked it. ⚠️ **The applied
  multiplier is `rest_minutes_factor` (0.83) prorated across the horizon, not 0.83 itself** — at
  a 5-gameweek horizon and a 2-gameweek window it is (2×0.83 + 3×1.00)/5 = **0.93 at GW1**, 0.97
  at GW2, 1.00 from GW3. The unprorated version is a bug this code has already paid for.

Two unrelated mechanisms answer to the word "rest": `ShortRestPenalty` and `VeryShortRest` are
congestion and are inert, while `rest_players` is the post-tournament teamsheet and is not.
`restFactor` has two further call sites in `metrics.go` — one un-applies it to build
`SettledMinutes` for the pool filters, and one is reporting-only and labelled as such, which
reads misleadingly like confirmation that nothing is scored.

**The rest list is a teamsheet, not a squad list, and it looks incomplete because it is supposed
to.** Read the Go comment on `DefaultRestPlayers` before editing `config.json`'s copy, and see
[configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the rule and the worked list.
