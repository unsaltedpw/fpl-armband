# Build the armband binary and ship it on a distroless base.
#
# The image is deliberately GENERIC: the binary and nothing else. No config.json,
# no cached FPL data, no overrides. A deployment supplies its own config as a
# mount and its own data as a volume, so this image says nothing about where or
# how it is run.
#
# Both bases are pinned by DIGEST, not tag. golang:1.26.7-alpine is rebuilt on
# Alpine security updates and distroless :nonroot is republished on every CA
# bundle refresh, so a tag would let the shipped runtime change without this
# file recording that it had -- the same rule the workflow applies to actions,
# and the base image is the larger surface of the two.

# The module declares go 1.26.7. GOTOOLCHAIN=local turns a version mismatch into
# a build error rather than a silent download of a different compiler. (The
# golang image already sets this; restated so the guarantee does not depend on
# the base keeping it.)
#
# ⚠️ THAT COUPLING IS REAL AND IT BITES. Bumping go.mod without moving this digest
# fails the image build with `go.mod requires go >= X (running Y; GOTOOLCHAIN=local)`
# — which is the guarantee working, not a defect. It happened on the 1.26.5 -> 1.26.7
# bump that took seven reachable CVEs to zero: go.mod moved, this digest did not, and
# both the image build and the new Trivy scan went red until it did. **Move them in
# the same commit.**

# -trimpath strips the build path and -buildid= drops the last non-deterministic
# field, so two builds of one commit produce an identical BINARY. That is a
# claim about the binary only: the image digest additionally depends on the
# pinned bases above, AND on the layer and config timestamps this Dockerfile
# has no say over -- COPY stamps a layer with the wall-clock of whichever build
# ran it, so two builds of one commit produced different digests even with an
# identical binary and identical pinned bases. .github/workflows/image.yml
# closes that gap by setting SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH from the commit itself and
# passing rewrite-timestamp=true to the image exporter, which together fix
# both the OCI config's `created` field and every layer's file mtimes to that
# one value. A local `docker build` without those two settings will still
# produce a fresh digest per invocation; that is expected, not a defect here.
